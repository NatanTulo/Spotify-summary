# Spotify Analytics - Project Restructuring Summary

## 🏗️ Major Changes Made

### 1. **Project Structure Reorganization**

Reorganized the entire project around three core content types: **Music**, **Podcasts**, and **Audiobooks**.

#### Backend Structure:

```

#### Frontend Structure:

```
frontend/src/
├── pages/
│   ├── music/          # Music-related pages (future)
│   ├── podcasts/       # Podcast pages
│   │   └── Podcasts.tsx
│   ├── audiobooks/     # Audiobook pages
│   │   └── Audiobooks.tsx
│   ├── Dashboard.tsx
│   └── Analytics.tsx
```

### 2. **Removed Legacy/Unused Files**

- ❌ `VideoPlay.ts` - Legacy video model (replaced with `PodcastPlay.ts`)
- ❌ `Episode2.ts` - Duplicate file from repair process
- 🔄 Renamed `video.ts` → `podcasts.ts` for consistent naming

### 3. **Terminology Standardization**

- **Video** → **Podcasts** (more accurate for the actual content)
- **VideoPlay** → **PodcastPlay**
- **totalVideoPlays** → **totalPodcastPlays**
- All variable names, API endpoints, and UI text updated consistently

### 4. **Enhanced Data Model**

#### Three Content Types Support:

1. **Music**: `Artist` → `Album` → `Track` → `Play`
2. **Podcasts**: `Show` → `Episode` → `PodcastPlay`
3. **Audiobooks**: `Audiobook` → `AudiobookPlay`

#### Fixed Model Relationships:

- Added missing `Episode` relationship to `PodcastPlay`
- Corrected import paths for moved models
- Updated foreign key relationships

### 5. **Import System Improvements**

- Updated JSON-based content categorization
- Enhanced statistics tracking for all three content types
- Fixed Profile model to use proper statistics structure
- Updated progress tracking for comprehensive content types

### 6. **API Enhancements**

#### New Routes:

- `/api/podcasts` - Podcast management (renamed from `/api/video`)
- `/api/audiobooks` - Audiobook management (new)

#### Updated Endpoints:

- Statistics now include podcast and audiobook data
- Profile statistics properly structured
- All endpoints use consistent naming conventions

### 7. **Frontend Updates**

#### New Components:

- `Audiobooks.tsx` - Complete audiobook listening history interface
- Updated `Podcasts.tsx` - Renamed from `VideoPodcasts.tsx`

#### Route Updates:

- `/podcasts` - Podcast interface (renamed from `/video`)
- `/audiobooks` - New audiobook interface

### 8. **Type System Updates**

Updated `shared/types.ts`:

- `SpotifyVideoPlay` → `SpotifyPodcastPlay`
- `VideoStats` → `PodcastStats`
- Added comprehensive audiobook interfaces
- Consistent naming across all types
